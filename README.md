# Framespace

Framespace was a project I have been working on for a while. You can make websites and export them as pages.

# What You Can Do With FrameSpace
1) Create Elements to your website
2) Drag and drop functionality
3) Create and export pages
4) Edit text

# Warning

As of December 25, 2025, there is an ofset in the exported page. To center something on the exported page, you need to move the part to the right of the screen.

Each Page is exported seperately. Exported HTML is does not have built in pages.

# NOT MENT FOR MOBILE DEVICES
